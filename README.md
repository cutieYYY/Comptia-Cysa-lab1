Assisted Lab: Exploring the Lab Environment

This README outlines my experience and tasks completed during the "Exploring the Lab Environment" exercise as part of the CySA+ Exam (CS0-003) preparation. I personally navigated through various configurations and lab tools, focusing on Kali Linux, network commands, and interacting with the lab environment.

Lab Experience:
In this lab, I became familiar with the Kali Linux virtual machine (VM) and successfully completed a series of tasks designed to test my understanding of basic commands, VM configurations, and the functionality of the lab interface. The goal was to simulate a real-world environment and ensure readiness for the CySA+ exam.

My Completed Tasks:
1. Identifying the Kali VM Name:
Task: Identify the correct name of the Kali Linux VM.
Action: I determined the VM's name by reviewing the interface.
Answer: kali
Score: 1
2. Validating File Creation:
Task: Verify the creation of a file in the VM.
Action: I located the file path and confirmed its content.
Result: File creation and validation were successful.
Score: 1
3. Retrieving the Ethernet Configuration (IPv4):
Task: Extract the inet (IPv4) address for eth0 from a configuration file.
Action: I accessed and reviewed the eth0_Config.txt file to find the IPv4 address.
Answer: 10.1.16.66
Score: 1
4. Maximizing VM Display in the Lab Interface:
Task: Identify which lab interface menu option maximizes the VM display.
Action: I explored the lab interface menus and selected the option to adjust the display.
Answer: Display
Score: 1
5. Exploring the Hamburger Menu Options:
Task: List the available options in the 3-line hamburger menu.
Action: I reviewed the menu and identified the following options.
Answers:
Windows Key
Save
Split Windows
CTRL-ALT-DEL
End
Score: 1
6. Finding VM Credentials:
Task: Identify where VM username and password credentials are displayed.
Action: I located the credentials in the lab interface using the following tabs:
Answers:
Commands
Display
Resources
Instructions
Score: 1
7. Entering Commands in Kali Linux VM:
Task: Confirm whether commands must be manually entered into the VM.
Action: I executed the commands manually within the Kali Linux VM.
Answer: True
Score: 1
8. Repeating Tasks:
Task: Determine what types of questions can be repeated.
Action: After some trial, I confirmed that various types of questions can be reattempted if incorrect.
Answer: All of the above
Score: 1
Final Results:
Total Score: 8/8
Completion Time: 38 minutes, 41 seconds
Key Learnings and Insights:
Kali VM Mastery: I gained practical experience interacting with Kali Linux, particularly in tasks such as file creation validation and network configuration retrieval.
Lab Interface Navigation: I enhanced my familiarity with the lab environment, including using display features, locating credentials, and managing multiple windows.
Task Repetition: I learned that inline questions, verifications, and comprehensive questions can be repeated to improve accuracy and understanding.
This lab provided valuable hands-on practice, strengthening my understanding of essential CySA+ concepts, preparing me for the exam, and improving my confidence in navigating both the Kali VM and the lab interface.
